### Docker remote container setup with Visual Studio Code

I've created a Dockerfile which allows you to run a development environment in [Docker](https://www.docker.com).

    - Windows users must have [Windows Subsystem for Linux](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/remote/containers#_system-requirements).
- [VSCode editor](https://code.visualstudio.com).
- [VSCode Terraform extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=hashicorp.terraform)
